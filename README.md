Communication:
-In person communication was great, each team member was working on a feature for the duration of the project. If it came down to making a decision we all pow-wowwed to get on the same page.

-We flushed out our ideas in whiteboarding sessions and sketched out our api details in a Google doc for real-time updating

-Links, pictures and ideas were shared on Slack in a private group

-We used Basecamp as a project management tool to build our project management app (interesting...)

-We found that our productivity greatly improved when we were all pair programming on the same tasks

--
Decisions:
-We decided to drop the Groups model to reduce the complexity for the scope of the project.
